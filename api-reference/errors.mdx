## Error schema

We use standard HTTP response codes for success and failure notifications, and our errors are further classified by type.

### `validation_error`

- **Status:** 400
- **Message:** We found an error with one or more fields in the request.
- **Suggested action:** The message will contain more details about what field and error were found.

### `method_not_allowed`

- **Status:** 405
- **Message:** Method is not allowed for the requested path.
- **Suggested action:** Change your API endpoint to use a valid method.

### `rate_limit_exceeded`

- **Status:** 429
- **Message:** You have exceeded your request limit. Please try again later.
- **Suggested action:** You should read the [response headers](./rate-limit) and reduce the rate at which you request the API. This can be done by introducing a queue mechanism or reducing the number of concurrent requests per second. If you have specific requirements, [contact support](https://resend.com/contact) to request a rate increase.

### `missing_api_key`

- **Status:** 401
- **Message:** Missing API key in the authorization header.
- **Suggested action:** Include the following header in the request: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.

### `invalid_api_key`

- **Status:** 403
- **Message:** API key is invalid.
- **Suggested action:** Make sure the API key is correct or generate a new [API key in the dashboard](https://app.mpesaflow.com/api-keys).

### `not_found`

- **Status:** 404
- **Message:** The requested endpoint does not exist.
- **Suggested action:** Change your request URL to match a valid API endpoint.

### `internal_server_error`

- **Status:** 500
- **Message:** An unexpected error occurred.
- **Suggested action:** Try the request again later. If the error does not resolve, check our [status page](https://status.mpesaflow.com) for service updates.
