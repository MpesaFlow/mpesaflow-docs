## Base URL

The MpesaFlow API is built on **REST** principles. We enforce **HTTPS** in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support **HTTP**.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://api.mpesaflow.dev
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an _Authorization_ header with the contents of the header being `Bearer mf_test_1234567890` where `mf_test_1234567890` is your [API Key](https://app.mpesaflow.com/api-keys).

```
Authorization: Bearer mf_test_1234567890
```

## Response codes

MpesaFlow uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures, and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Description                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `200`  | Successful request.                        |
| `400`  | Check that the parameters were correct.    |
| `401`  | The API key used was missing.              |
| `403`  | The API key used was invalid.              |
| `404`  | The resource was not found.                |
| `429`  | The rate limit was exceeded.               |
| `5xx`  | Indicates an error with MpesaFlow servers. |
