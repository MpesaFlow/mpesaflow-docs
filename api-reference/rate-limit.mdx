To ensure fair usage and protect the stability of the MpesaFlow API, requests are subject to **rate limits**.  

Rate limits vary depending on the **environment** you are using `production` vs `development`.  

## How Rate Limits Work

- Each request you make to the API consumes from a **rate limit quota**.  
- If you exceed your allocated limit, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.  
- Rate limits are **scoped to your environment** (production or development).  
  - Requests in **development** do not affect your **production quota**, and vice versa.

## Rate Limit Headers

Every response from the API includes rate limit headers so you can programmatically track your remaining quota:

| Header                  | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make.       |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.           |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |

When the rate limit is exceeded, an error is returned with the status “429 Too Many Requests”:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "status": 429,
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "You have exceeded your request limit. Please try again later."
  }
}
```

## Environment-Based Limits

We apply different rate limits depending on your environment:

| Environment   | Requests per minute | Burst capacity |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Production** | 100 requests/min     | 200 requests   |
| **Development** | 20 requests/min      | 50 requests    |

- Use **development keys** to build and test without worrying about exhausting your production quota.  
- Switch to **production keys** when you go live with your integration.
