The MpesaFlow API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in API Keys paage in the MpesaFlow Dashboard.

You can view and manage your API Keys on the [API Keys](https://app.mpesaflow.com/api-keys) page in the MpesaFlow Dashboard.

Development API keys have the prefix `mf_test_` and Production API keys have the prefix `mf_live_`.

Authentication to the API is performed via the Authorization header with a Bearer token. To authenticate, you need to include the Authorization header with the word Bearer followed by your token in your API requests like so:

```terminal
Authorization: Bearer mf_test_1234567890
```
