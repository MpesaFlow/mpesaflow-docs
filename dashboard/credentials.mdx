To process payments through M-Pesa, you’ll need to connect your **Safaricom Daraja API credentials** to MpesaFlow.

We support both development (sandbox) and production credentials. Each environment uses a separate set of credentials for safety.

## How Credentials Work

Credentials are used to authenticate with Safaricom’s Daraja API when sending a payment request. MpesaFlow uses these credentials to securely request access tokens from Safaricom.

<Warning>
Although we auto-assign sandbox credentials in the development environment, **you can also bring your own test credentials**. Only use test credentials provided by Safaricom for development.
</Warning>

You can manage your credentials in the [MpesaFlow dashboard →](https://app.mpesaflow.com/credentials)

## Authorization (Consumer Key & Secret)

When MpesaFlow makes a request to Daraja, it must first authenticate using your:

- **Consumer Key**
- **Consumer Secret**

These are used to request an **access token**, which is then used to authorize M-Pesa transactions.

MpesaFlow handles the token exchange securely behind the scenes. You don’t need to manage this process manually.


## M-Pesa Express Request

We use your credentials to send M-Pesa Express (STK Push) requests to Safaricom. This includes:

- Amount to charge
- Customer's phone number
- Account reference and transaction description

You can configure these values through the MpesaFlow API or SDK when initiating a payment.

For example, a typical payment might include:

```json
{
  "amount": "100",
  "phoneNumber": "254712345678",
  "transactionDesc": "Product Payment",
  "accountReference": "MyBusiness"
}
