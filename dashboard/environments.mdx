MpesaFlow provides two environments **development** and **production** to help you build, test, and manage payments confidently.

Each environment is isolated to support a different stage of your integration.

## Development Environment

Use the **development** environment to test your integration without sending real money. It uses Safaricom’s Daraja **sandbox**, allowing you to simulate payments and verify your setup safely.

When you create an API key here, it begins with `mf_test_`, so you can clearly separate test data from live data.

**What’s included:**

- Simulate payments using sandbox credentials
- Automatically assigned test credentials when you create an organization
- Ability to add your own test (sandbox) credentials
- API key and team management for testing
- Supports all MpesaFlow features without affecting real users

<Warning>
Only use **Safaricom’s official sandbox credentials** in the development environment. Never use production credentials here.
</Warning>

You can manage your credentials [here](https://app.mpesaflow.com/credentials).

## Production Environment

Use the **production** environment when you're ready to go live and accept real payments.

You’ll need to provide your **live Daraja credentials** before you can start processing real transactions. API keys in this environment begin with `mf_live_`.

**What’s included:**

- Accept live M-Pesa payments
- Provide your own verified Daraja credentials
- Generate and manage secure production API keys
- View transaction data
- View customer data
- Add team members
- Analytics
- Webhook support (coming soon)

Always test your integration in the development environment before switching to production.
